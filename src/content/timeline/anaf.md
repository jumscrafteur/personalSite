An internship with the Association Nationale des Apprentis de France (ANAF).

The primary missions involved updating and improving the Mesaidesapprenti.fr website, an online simulator designed to
help apprentices identify available financial aid.

The project, initially developed by an external agency, required in-depth recovery and analysis of the source code,
despite the absence of documentation.

The main tasks included redesigning the site's graphics to improve ergonomics and accessibility, as well as optimizing
the backoffice to better manage usage statistics and better understand user needs.
