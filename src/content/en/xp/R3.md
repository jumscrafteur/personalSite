An association that promotes access to knowledge by offering private tutoring to students in
difficulty and organizing conferences on the life of an engineering student.


As well as taking part in the association's activities as a member, my involvement as
treasurer has enabled me to acquire additional skills, such as teamwork and managing a bank
account.
