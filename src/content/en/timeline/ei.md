6-month Internship at Euro-Information, the IT branch of **CrÃ©dit Mutuel Alliance FÃ©dÃ©rale**

This internship involved migrating marketing automation processes from Adobe Campaign to Unica Campaign. Key objectives included: analyzing the existing integration of Adobe Campaign, assessing user requirements, and evaluating the capabilities of Unica Campaign.

During this experience, I developed expertise in administering both Adobe Campaign and Unica Campaign. I also gained valuable project management skills.
