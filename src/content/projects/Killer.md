The Killer is a life-size game held annually on the Bourges campus of INSA Centre Val de Loire. Each player gets a card
with a QR code and uses an app to discover their target and two available weapons. The goal: eliminate your target with
a weapon while avoiding being eliminated by your own hunter.
